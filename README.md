## About

[tweakpane](https://github.com/cocopon/tweakpane) was the main inspiration for this project.  I recommend it over `gooey` -- it's a more lightweight solution with more features and an awesome, highly active developer!

I started this to scratch an itch, and pave the way for more advanced features related to 3D / audio / audio-reactivity in the future.
